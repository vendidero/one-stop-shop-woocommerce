The One Stop Shop compliance helper allows you to easily monitor your One Stop Shop delivery threshold within WooCommerce and generate detailed tax reports.

== Description ==

One Stop Shop for WooCommerce adds compliance with the new [One Stop Shop procedure](https://vat-one-stop-shop.ec.europa.eu) of the european union to WooCommerce.
With the help of this little plugin you may easily monitor the delivery threshold (10.000 â‚¬) for B2C exports to other EU countries. Furthermore you may generate tax reports (e.g. quarterly, monthly, yearly) applicable to the OSS procedure and export them as CSV to easily notify your local tax authorities about your sales.

* *Delivery Threshold Observation* - The plugin may automatically observe the yearly delivery threshold and send notices by email and via the admin panel in case the threshold is close to being reached.
* *Detailed Tax Reports* - Generate detailed tax reports (e.g. per tax rate, per country) of your WooCommerce orders and export them as CSV.
* *Refresh Tax Rates* - Automatically refresh your EU tax rates based on scheduled changes, e.g. (new/updated) tax rates for Estonia starting 01-01-2024.
* *Import Tax Rates* - Import tax rates based on current EU VAT rates.
* *Tax Classes per Country* - Depending on the product, different tax classes may apply for different EU countries. Choose tax classes per country for your WooCommerce products.
